# skellam

Skellam is a personal python project I have been working on which allows you to predict variables that belong to the skellam distribution.


The Skellam distribution is a frequency distribution of the difference between two independent variates following the 
same Poisson distribution. One notable example that follows a Skellam distribution is the margin in a soccer game as this is the difference
between two Poisson distributed variables, the home team's score and the away tea'ms score.
